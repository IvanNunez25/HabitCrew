This respository is for the Oracle APEX challenge - HackMTY 2024

## What is Oracle APEX?
Oracle APEX is the world's most popular low-code application platform that allows users to develop secure, scalable web and mobile applications that can be deployed anywhere, either on-premises or in the cloud, and that have first-class features.

## How it works?
Oracle APEX is data-controlled and development usually begins with a spreadsheet or data model. Applications are developed in a browser-based environment with little code, where it is possible to remove 98% of manual encoding.

Oracle APEX works directly with data from database tables. Most mid-level applications must define application data structures to retain, convert, maintain, and interact with data flows between the application and the database. This is a significantly underestimated source of complexity that Oracle APEX completely eliminates.

## Our team
As part of Oracle's challenge at HackMTY 2024, an application was developed that seeks to help people maintain control and monitor their habits, promoting collaboration between users in order to create a sense of commitment and persistence in their goals.
